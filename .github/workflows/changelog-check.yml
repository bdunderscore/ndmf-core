# this workflow checks CHANGELOG.md & CHANGELOG-SNAPSHOTS.md is updated correctly
# to skip this check, include `NO-CHANGELOG` for CHANGELOG.md
# and `NO-CHANGELOG-PRERELEASE` for CHANGELOG-PRERELEASE.md in tags of PR.
# also, this action ignores `dependencies` pull requests (expected to be generated by dependabot)
